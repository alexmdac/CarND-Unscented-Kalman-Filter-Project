# Unscented Kalman Filter Project

This is my solution for the UKF project for Udacity's
[Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/drive).

## Building and Running

Install Docker, `cd` to the directory in the repo containing the `run-docker.sh`
script, and run that script. Within the container, build and run the code as follows.

```bash
mkdir ../build
cd ../build
cmake ../work
make
./UnscentedKF
```

You can then run the [simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/),
and it should connect to the port exposed by the container. Note that on some platforms you
may need to whitelist port 4567 for forwarding by Docker.
